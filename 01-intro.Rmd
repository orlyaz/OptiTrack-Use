# Calibration {#Calibration}

As mentioned, in the Intro\@ref(intro), OptiTrack is useful for tracking movements using cameras. In order for OptiTrack to collect the movement data properly, the cameras must have a good view of the sensors in the area in which you are collecting data.

In order to make sure that the cameras are tracking sensors properly, the system must be calibrated around twice a week.
